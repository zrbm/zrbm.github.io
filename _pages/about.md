I am a self‑motivated thinker, researcher, and writer from Bangladesh with a growing academic background in the life
sciences. I have a strong interest in how knowledge can address today’s health, social, and other issues. My writing explores
various topics such as public health, including eating disorders (EDs), mental health, one health approaches, and the global
education crisis. I incorporate insights from the humanities to enhance the understanding of the human stories behind data
and scientific findings.

Besides research, I value intellectual and creative exploration — from writing and argument to civic engagement and entrepreneurial
pursuits. These experiences have enriched my critical thinking, interdisciplinarity, and ability to contribute to
projects in science, society, and innovation.

In the coming years, I aim to continue growing as a researcher and collaborator, contributing value to initiatives that promote
health equity, education, and interdisciplinary learning and collaboration, while developing solutions that align scientific principles
with people‑oriented thinking.
