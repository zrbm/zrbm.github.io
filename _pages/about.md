I am a self-motivated thinker, researcher, and writer with a growing academic background in the life sciences and a strong interest in how knowledge can address today's health, social and other issues. My writing explores topics such as public health, mental health, One Health approaches, and the global education crisis, incorporating insights from the humanities to deepen the understanding of the human story behind data and science.

Besides research, I value intellectual and creative exploration â€” from writing and argument to civic engagement and entrepreneurial pursuits. These experiences have enriched my critical thinking, interdisciplinarity, and ability to contribute to projects in science, society, and innovation.

In the coming years, I aim to continue growing as a researcher and collaborator, contributing value to initiatives that promote health equity, education, and interdisciplinary learning and collaboration, while developing solutions that align scientific principles with people-oriented thinking.
